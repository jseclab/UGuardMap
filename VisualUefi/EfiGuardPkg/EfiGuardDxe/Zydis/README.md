<p align="center">Fast and lightweight x86/x86-64 disassembler and code generation library.</p>

## Features

- Supports all x86 and x86-64 (AMD64) instructions and [extensions](./include/Zydis/Generated/EnumISAExt.h)
- Optimized for high performance
- No dynamic memory allocation ("malloc")
- Thread-safe by design
- Very small file-size overhead compared to other common disassembler libraries
- [Complete doxygen documentation](https://doc.zydis.re/)
- Absolutely no third party dependencies — not even libc
  - Should compile on any platform with a working C11 compiler
  - Tested on Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, Linux and UEFI, both user and kernel mode

## Examples

### Disassembler

The following example program uses Zydis to disassemble a given memory buffer and prints the output to the console.

https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/blob/214536a814ba20d2e33d2a907198d1a329aac45c/examples/DisassembleSimple.c#L38-L63

The above example program generates the following output:

```asm
007FFFFFFF400000   push rcx
007FFFFFFF400001   lea eax, [rbp-0x01]
007FFFFFFF400004   push rax
007FFFFFFF400005   push qword ptr [rbp+0x0C]
007FFFFFFF400008   push qword ptr [rbp+0x08]
007FFFFFFF40000B   call [0x008000007588A5B1]
007FFFFFFF400011   test eax, eax
007FFFFFFF400013   js 0x007FFFFFFF42DB15
```

### Encoder

https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/blob/b37076e69f5aa149fde540cae43c50f15a380dfc/examples/EncodeMov.c#L39-L62

The above example program generates the following output:

```
48 C7 C0 37 13 00 00
```

### More Examples

More examples can be found in the [examples](./examples/) directory of this repository.

## Build

### Unix

Zydis builds cleanly on most platforms without any external dependencies. You can use CMake to generate project files for your favorite C11 compiler.

```bash
git clone --recursive 'https://github.com/zyantific/zydis.git'
cd zydis
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Windows

Either use the [Visual Studio 2022 project](./msvc/) or build Zydis using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) ([video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fywLDK1OAtQ)).

#### Building Zydis - Using vcpkg

You can download and install Zydis using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg integrate install
./vcpkg install zydis
```
The Zydis port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

## Using Zydis in a CMake project

An example on how to use Zydis in your own CMake based project [can be found in this repo](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis-submodule-example).

## Versions

### Scheme

Versions follow the [semantic versioning scheme](https://semver.org/). All stability guarantees apply to the API only — ABI stability between patches cannot be assumed unless explicitly mentioned in the release notes.

### Branches & Tags

- `master` holds the bleeding edge code of the next, unreleased Zydis version. Elevated amounts of bugs and issues must be expected, API stability is not guaranteed outside of tagged commits.
- Stable and preview versions are annotated with git tags
  - beta and other preview versions have `-beta`, `-rc`, etc. suffixes
- `maintenance/v2` contains the code of the latest legacy release of v2
  - v2 is now deprecated, but will receive security fixes until 2021

- [LLVM](https://llvm.org) (for providing pretty solid instruction data as well)
- Christian Ludloff (https://sandpile.org, insanely helpful)

## Troubleshooting

### `-fPIC` for shared library builds

```
/usr/bin/ld: ./libfoo.a(foo.c.o): relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `bar' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
```

Under some circumstances (e.g. when building Zydis as a static library using
CMake and then using Makefiles to manually link it into a shared library), CMake
might fail to detect that relocation information must be emitted. This can be forced
by passing `-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON` to the CMake invocation.
